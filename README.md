## Summary

Wow, this was long! Basically I went through the Node Express Tutorial on Express and it was very long! Not only that, but I also went through a course on the main MongoDB site. So yeah, it was a lot.

Anyways, this app was made from the tutorial where users are allowed to add books, instances or copies of those books, authors, genres in the library. Typical CRUD features on the application and all of the features are from the NoSQL database MongoDB.
